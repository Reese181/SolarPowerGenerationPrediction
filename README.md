# Abstract
Due to its weather-dependency, forecasting the power generated by photovoltaic systems is essential for effective grid management, optimizing energy consumption, and promoting sustainable practices. This paper explores two forecasting methods, Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), to identify the most suitable model for predicting the monthly power generated by photovoltaic systems in Germany over an 18-month horizon. The results indicate that both methods produce similar and well-performing models. Among them, the ETS (A,A,M) model exhibits the lowest forecast errors. Leveraging this model, the power generation from July 2023 to December 2024 is expected to follow the same seasonal developments observed in previous years. However, there is also the possibility of an all-time peak in solar power generation in Germany during summer 2024.
